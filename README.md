This repository contains the (Python) assignments that were handed in for the course Pattern Recognition (for CS) of the University of Groningen. 

## Laboratory 1

In this assignment, we performed person authentication using the normalized Hamming Distance between binary iris patterns of different persons and image matching using the SIFT detector provided by the Python module $opencv$.

## Laboratory 2

In this assignment, we used the convolutional neural network (CNN) ResNet-18 to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and build our own 4-layer CNN for the same image classification problem in order to compare the results between the two CNNs.

## Laboratory 3

In this assignment, we have implemented a Generative adversarial network (GAN) for natural image synthesis.
